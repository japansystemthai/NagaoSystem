There are such principles of pulverizing by giving mechanical energy.<br>
<br>
Crushing is mainly performed by four types of actions, compression force, impact force, friction force and shear force.
<br>
<br>
【Compressive force】<br>
→ Crush the sample by crushing the sample using a material with higher hardness than the sample to be crushed.<br>
<br>
【Frictional force】<br>
→ Grind the sample to a material with higher hardness than the sample to be pulverized.
<br>
    <br>
【Impact force】 (Container, Sample & Sample)<br>
→ Crush the sample against a material of higher hardness than the sample to be crushed.
→ Samples are crushed and crushed.<br>
<br>
【Shear force】<br>
→ Fix the sample to be pulverized and crush it.<br>
If the frictional force in this acts greatly, the particles become finer.
<br><br>
The grinder is classified as follows<br>
・ Coarse / medium grinding of 500 μm to 10 mm<br>
・ 10 to 500 μm fine grinding machine<br><br>
・ Super fine pulverizer of 1 to 10 μm<br>
・ Nano crushing machine of 1 μm or less<br>
<br>
・Coarse / medium grinding of 500 μm 0 to 10 mm<br>
From the state of the lumps it is necessary to crush the coarse and medium by surface crushing of compressive force / shear force (volume crushing)<br>
Mainly hammer mill ・ feather mill.<br>
<br>
・ 10 to 500 μm fine grinding machine<br>
The pulverizer crushes using compression, shear, impact force of the rotor.<br>
Mainly valperizer, pin mill, high brely tighter<br>
<br>
・ Super fine pulverizer of 1 to 10 μm<br>
Fine milling Below we use compression, shear, impact and friction force of jet air current such as high pressure oxygen, gas (cooling ・ helium) etc.<br>
Mainly Jet mill ・ Aquamiser<br>
<br>
・ Nano crushing machine of 1 μm or less<br>
  Our products which utilize four kinds of forces of compression, impact, shear, friction force by strong G are effective.<br>

                3次元ボールミルQ&A3D Ball Mill Q&A
                  </u>
                <br>
                  <br>
                  3D Ball Mill(3D Reactor) Q&A
                  <br>
                  ①What is the difference between a planetary ball mill and a 3D ball mill(３D Reactor)?<br>
A 3D ball mill(3D Reactor) is a ball mill having two longitudinal and transverse axes, like a gyroshin single.Since balls move in random directions by adjusting the rotation of the two axes, we have made it possible to efficiently crush using the whole container rather than a planetary ball mill.<br>
The possibility that crushing can not be done by the planetary ball mill can be increased, and the possibility of shortening the crushing time also increases.
Compared with the planetary ball mill, highly uniform crushing, mixing and dispersing have been made possible.
<br>
  <br>
②What is the difference between pulverization of planetary ball mill and 3D ball mill(３D Reactor)?<br>
In the 3D ball mill(3D Reactor), crushing balls and crushed material hit the entire container, and the crushing power exceeding Planet series and planetary ball mill is <br>realized.Furthermore, since the 3D ball mill(3D Reactor) moves around in the container at all times, solidification is hardly done especially when dry pulverizing.<br>
That is, there is a high possibility that the solidification problem at the time of dry milling, which was a weak point of the planetary ball mill, can be solved.<br>
Furthermore, It is good at mixing substances with different specific gravity and viscosity.
<br>
  <br>
Milling strength ⇒ futility without waste is a feature.Batch type, more finely crushed uniformly with single peak.Moreover, the edges of the particles after milling are round and keep the particle shape.
<br>
  <br>
Strength of mixing / dispersion ⇒ It is good at uniform mixture dispersion using the wall of the container without waste without using a propeller.
<br>
    <br>
③Are there consumables for 3D ball mill(３D Reactor)?
Rubber and bearings to be contacted during rotation.If you think of it as a car, think of wear exchange on the tire.The advantage of rubber contact is that the sound is quiet, the use of gears and gears is slight, and features of failure are few.
<br>
    <br>
④Is it safe without a cooling fan?
Unlike the Planet series and the planetary ball mill, the 3D ball mill milling and mixes using the entire container, so it is almost impossible to disperse the heat of crushing throughout the container and become hot.
<br>
    <br>
⑤Is it possible to investigate whether it can be crushed with a 3D ball mill(３D Reactor)?
Except for hazardous materials that have an effect on the human body, it is possible if it is a small amount (about 100 g or less).Please send a small sample (less than 100 g) or (Asaku-ku Kawasaki-city Kanagawa-Pref.)Odakyu Line Kakio Station in front of our exhibition room so we experiment with the engineers using various machines.It is possible to receive.Based on the experimental results, we believe that it will be easier to decide the model, container material and so on.I look forward to hearing from you.

⑥What kind of materials can be crushed with the 3D ball mill(３D Reactor)?
If it can crush with a hammer, most things can be crushed.The one which can not be broken is plastic such as PET bottle, agar when it is food.However, it can be pulverized if hardened with liquid nitrogen or the like.Sticky metals such as Ag can be broken depending on the pulverization method, but in some cases it is larger than before pulverization.
<br>

⑦Is it possible to milling organic matter with a 3D ball mil(３D Reactor)l?
Organic matter crushing is possible.The crushing of inorganic matter is the field of good grinding of planetary ball mill.However, it is difficult to crush organic matter due to heat of impact / frictional force.However, in case of 3D ball mill(3D Reactor), since the entire container surface is utilized, heat is dispersed and it is difficult to reach high temperature.Therefore it is also possible to crush organic substances and substances sensitive to heat.
<br>
    <br>
⑧What was the crushing experience of the 3D ball mill(３D Reactor)?
It is 10 nanometers with titanium oxide when wet.Pulverization to submicron class is possible if dry type.Furthermore, it crushes for a shorter time than the planetary ball mill.Moreover, it realized uniform pulverization of single peak.
<br>
  <br>
⑨What kind of substance is suitable for 3D ball mill(３D Reactor) crushing?
Since the container diameter is larger than Planet series, it is possible to crush a large amount.<br>
It is recommended for those who were satisfied with the crushing amount of the planetary ball mill.<br>
Furthermore, since the surface of the milling container is used without waste with a strong frictional force, the pulverization, mixing and dispersion are beautiful with the single peak particle diameter.<br>
⑩Could you crush about 5g?<br>
Is possible.There is a medium-size and small 3D ball mill(3D Reactor).
· Medium-size 3D ball mill (3D Reactor)⇒ 1 batch amount about 100g (ml)～1,200g (ml)"
· Small-Size ３D ball mill (3D Reactor) ⇒1 batch amount about 2g(ml) ～100g (ml).
<br>
⑪Can we mix substances with different specific gravity and viscosity with a 3D Ball Mill(３D Reactor)?<br>
The combination of substances with different gravities and viscosities is thought to make the best use of the characteristics of the 3D ball mill.There is a big possibility as a 3D reactor.
<br><br>
⑫Is there a free loan of 3D Ball Mil(３D Reactor)l?<br>
We do not lend out both free of charge and fee.<br>
It is only for use with technical personnel in our company's exhibition room.
<br><br>
⑬ Is there a larger capacity product than the current model of 3D Ball Mill(３D Reactor)?
We do not have it.<br>
However, we are looking for a joint development company of large capacity products.<br>
Consultation of license out is also possible.<br>
<br><br>
Creative ball mill with high speed 3D action<br>
· Ultrafine milling (nanoscale pulverization)<br>
· Mechanochemical reaction<br>
· Synthesis of new substances (new materials) by mechanical alloying<br>
·amorphous<br>
Provide unknown possibilities in the above.<br>
In addition, it is also a machine that specializes in mixing with different specific gravity and viscosity.<br>
